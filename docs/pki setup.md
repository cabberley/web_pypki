# Establish multi-level OpenSSL Public Key Infrastructure 

## Step 1: Create a dedicated user for pki operations 
For security reasons it is preferable to create a dedicated user for use with your PKI and to ensure that only this user (or group of users) has access to this location. In our setup we will create a user called pki and use the homedirectory for this account as root for the PKI. 

```bash
adduser pki 
chmod -R 0700 /pkiroot 
```

> Make sure you repeat the last command when the PKI setup is completed to ensure that no files or directories remain world readable. 

## Step 2: Create the required directory structure and put the relevant files in place
The following directory structure is recommended as a skeleton for setting up a new PKI. Each Certificate Authority in your Public Key Infrastructure should have a directory structure similar to the one explained below. 

- **PKI directory**: Root directory for the OpenSSL PKI
- **CA directory** : Root directory for the Certificate Authority 
- **CA.db.tmp**: Temporary directory for openssl operations. This directory will mainly be used to store intermediary .pem files.
- **CA.db.certs**: Directory used to store generated certificates in .pem format. It is advised to create additional subdirectories corresponding to the common name of the generated certificate to hold certificates, private keys and other formats such as p12 containers for future reference. 
- **CA.crl**: Directory used to store certificate revocation lists generated by openssl.  Additionally the following files will need to be created for the CA to function properly. 
- **CA.db.serial**: File indicating serial to be used for the next generated certificate. The initial value should be 01. 
- **CA.db.crlserial**: File indicating serial to be used for the next CRL. The initial value should be 01. 
- **CA.db.index**: Text based database file used by OpenSSL to store details of all generated certificates. Initially this file should be empty. 
- **CA.db.rand**: File containing a random string which ensures the randomness of the CA. If security is of high importance it is recommended to use a hardware random key generator for this. 

To simplify our setup we will consistently use the following naming and extension convention throughout our PKI: 
- **.crt**: File containing a certificate 
- **.csr**: File containing a Certificate Signing Request 
- **.key**: File containing a private key 
- **.p12**: Binary container with certificate, private key and ca chain  
- **.pwd**: File containing the password used to open the p12 container 

The commands to put the above mentioned structure in place are mentioned below. Make sure you modify ca in the example to reflect the name of the CA you are putting in place and make sure you execute the commands within the proper location on the filesystem (in this example /home/pki/pki-root). 

```bash
mkdir ca 
mkdir ca/ca.db.tmp 
mkdir ca/ca.db.certs 
mkdir ca/ca.crl 
echo 01 > ca/ca.db.serial 
echo 01 > ca/ca.db.crlserial 
touch ca/ca.db.index 
openssl rand -out ca/ca.db.rand 8192 
```

**Example**: To create a two level CA structure in place with a root CA and one intermediate CA you would need to perform the following actions:

```bash
cd /pkiroot

# Create RootCA structure
mkdir RootCA
mkdir RootCA/ca.db.tmp 
mkdir RootCA/ca.db.certs 
mkdir RootCA/ca.crl 
echo 01 > RootCA/ca.db.serial 
echo 01 > RootCA/ca.db.crlserial 
touch RootCA/ca.db.index 
openssl rand -out RootCA/ca.db.rand 8192

# Create IntermCA structure
mkdir IntermCA
mkdir IntermCA/ca.db.tmp 
mkdir IntermCA/ca.db.certs 
mkdir IntermCA/ca.crl 
echo 01 > IntermCA/ca.db.serial 
echo 01 > IntermCA/ca.db.crlserial 
touch IntermCA/ca.db.index 
openssl rand -out IntermCA/ca.db.rand 8192
```

## Step 3: Configure OpenSSL through openssl.cnf 
The OpenSSL configuration file allows us to (pre-)define many of the settings related to our Certificate authority. Although many of these options can equally be set using command line parameters we can simplify our command lines and standardise the creation of certificates by using the configuration file. 
We will define the following aspects of our Certification Authority through the configuration file: 
  -  The Certification Authorities making up our Public Key Infrastructure and their related settings such as base directories and files. 
  -  The policies to be applied to certificate requests, indicating which fields are optional, mandatory and/or should match the Certification Authorities values. 
  -  The standard certificate request parameters to be used. 
  -  The extensions to be used when generating specific types of certificates. 
Let us create the OpenSSL file and place it in our root PKI directory (/home/pki/). The OpenSSL configuration file should start with a entry indicating which Certification Authority should be used by default is none is specified during certificate generation. 

```yaml
[ ca ] 
default_ca                      = CA # The default ca section 

[ RootCA ]   
dir                             = /pkiroot/CA                # Where everything is kept 
certificate                     = $dir/ca.crt             # The CA certificate
private_key                     = $dir/ca.key             # The private key 
RANDFILE                        = $dir/ca.db.rand         # private random number file  name_opt   = ca_default
new_certs_dir                   = $dir/ca.db.certs        # default place for new certs.     
certs                           = $dir/ca.db.certs        # Where the issued certs are kept
crl_dir                         = $dir/ca.db.crl          # Where the issued crl are kept 
database                        = $dir/ca.db.index        # database index file. 
unique_subject                  = no                      # Set to 'no' to allow creation of several certificates with same subject.  
serial                          = $dir/ca.db.serial       # The current serial number 
crlnumber                       = $dir/ca.db.crlserial    # the current crl number must be commented out to leave a V1 CRL  

# Subject Name options 
cert_opt                        = ca_default              # Certificate field options 
default_days                    = 365                     # how long to certify for 
default_crl_days                = 60                      # how long before next CRL 
default_md                      = md5                     # use public key default MD 
preserve                        = no                      # keep passed DN ordering 
policy                          = policy_match
```

As a next step we need to introduce a CA configuration section for each of the CAâ€™s which make up our Public Key Infrastructure.  
> if your PKI only consists of one CA you should only create one section. 

**Example**: To create a two level CA structure in place with a root CA and one intermediate CA you would need the following CA entries:

```yaml
[ ca ] 
default_ca                      = IntermCA # The default ca section 

[ RootCA ]   
dir                             = /pkiroot/RootCA                # Where everything is kept 
certificate                     = $dir/RootCA.crt             # The CA certificate
private_key                     = $dir/RootCA.key             # The private key 
RANDFILE                        = $dir/ca.db.rand         # private random number file  name_opt   = ca_default
new_certs_dir                   = $dir/ca.db.certs        # default place for new certs.     
certs                           = $dir/ca.db.certs        # Where the issued certs are kept
crl_dir                         = $dir/ca.db.crl          # Where the issued crl are kept 
database                        = $dir/ca.db.index        # database index file. 
unique_subject                  = no                      # Set to 'no' to allow creation of several certificates with same subject.  
serial                          = $dir/ca.db.serial       # The current serial number 
crlnumber                       = $dir/ca.db.crlserial    # the current crl number must be commented out to leave a V1 CRL  

# Subject Name options 
cert_opt                        = ca_default              # Certificate field options 
default_days                    = 365                     # how long to certify for 
default_crl_days                = 60                      # how long before next CRL 
default_md                      = md5                     # use public key default MD 
preserve                        = no                      # keep passed DN ordering 
policy                          = policy_match

[ IntermCA ]   
dir                             = /pkiroot/IntermCA                # Where everything is kept 
certificate                     = $dir/IntermCA.crt             # The CA certificate
private_key                     = $dir/IntermCA.key             # The private key 
RANDFILE                        = $dir/ca.db.rand         # private random number file  name_opt   = ca_default
new_certs_dir                   = $dir/ca.db.certs        # default place for new certs.     
certs                           = $dir/ca.db.certs        # Where the issued certs are kept
crl_dir                         = $dir/ca.db.crl          # Where the issued crl are kept 
database                        = $dir/ca.db.index        # database index file. 
unique_subject                  = no                      # Set to 'no' to allow creation of several certificates with same subject.  
serial                          = $dir/ca.db.serial       # The current serial number 
crlnumber                       = $dir/ca.db.crlserial    # the current crl number must be commented out to leave a V1 CRL  

# Subject Name options 
cert_opt                        = ca_default              # Certificate field options 
default_days                    = 365                     # how long to certify for 
default_crl_days                = 60                      # how long before next CRL 
default_md                      = md5                     # use public key default MD 
preserve                        = no                      # keep passed DN ordering 
policy                          = policy_match
```

> The options, **policy match** and **unique subject** are most commonly used for root certification authorities since you will want the attributes of the intermediary CAâ€™s to match the root CA and to ensure that you have a unique subject. 
These two options should potentially be modified for intermediary CAâ€™s. Make sure to modify the relevant values to reflect the configuration of the CAâ€™s you want to put in place. Additionally it is advisable to modify the defaultca parameter to contain the CA you want to use for signing certificates by default. 
Once we defined the CAâ€™s we have the option of creating a policy which will be applied to certificate signing requests.

By default the OpenSSL configuration file contains two policies called policymatch and policyanything. The first requires the request to match most of the values present in the CA certificate such as country name, state or province etc. 
The latter imposes no restrictions on the content of the certificate signing request. 

Letâ€™s go ahead and define our own policy which is to be used when signing user certificates. Feel free to modify the template below to match whatever requirements you want to put on specific types of certificate signing requests.

```yaml
[ policy_match ] 
countryName                     = match
stateOrProvinceName             = match
localityName                    = optional
organizationName                = optional
organizationalUnitName          = optional
commonName                      = supplied
emailAddress                    = optional 
 
[ policy_anything ] 
countryName                     = optional
stateOrProvinceName             = optional
localityName                    = optional
organizationName                = optional
organizationalUnitName          = optional
commonName                      = supplied
emailAddress                    = optional  
countryName_default             = BE
countryName_min                 = 2
countryName_max                 = 2

[ policy_usr ] 
countryName                     = supplied
stateOrProvinceName             = supplied
localityName                    = supplied
organizationName                = supplied
organizationalUnitName          = optional
commonName                      = supplied
emailAddress                    = supplied 
```

With our CAâ€™s and policies in place itâ€™s time to define the â€˜defaultâ€™ request parameters. Modify the parameters below to reflect your organisation 

```yaml
[ req ] 
default_bits                    = 2048 
default_keyfile                 = privkey.pem 
distinguished_name              = req_distinguished_name 
attributes                      = req_attributes 
x509_extensions                 = v3_ca # The extentions to add to the self signed cert  string_mask = nombstr 
 
[ req_distinguished_name ] 
countryName                     = Country Name (2 letter code) 
stateOrProvinceName             = State or Province Name (full name)
stateOrProvinceName_default     = Vlaams-Brabant 
localityName                    = Locality Name (eg, city) 
localityName_default            = Leuven 
0.organizationName              = Organization Name (eg, company)
0.organizationName_default      = Demo 
1.organizationName              = Second Organization Name (eg, company)
1.organizationName_default      = not used 
organizationalUnitName          = Organizational Unit Name (eg, section)
organizationalUnitName_default  = Demo CA project 

[ req_attributes ] 
commonName                      = Common Name (eg, YOUR name)   
commonName_max                  = 64
emailAddress                    = Email Address 
emailAddress_max                = 64                
# challengePassword             = A challenge password  
# challengePassword_min         = 4 
# challengePassword_max         = 20 
# unstructuredName              = An optional company name 
```

As a final step we have the option of defining specific extensions, contstraints and comments for specific certificate types. Below you find an example of server and user certificate types and their specifics. Make sure to modify the crlDistributionPoints and/or comment to reflect your environment.
 
```yaml
[ srv_cert ] 
basicConstraints                = CA:FALSE 
nsCertType                      = server 
crlDistributionPoints           = URI:http://example.com/crl.pem  
nsComment                       = "OpenSSL Generated Server Certificate"   

[ usr_cert ] 
basicConstraints                = CA:FALSE 
nsCertType                      = client, email 
nsComment                       = "OpenSSL Generated Client Certificate"
subjectKeyIdentifier            = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier          = keyid,issuer:always 

[ v3_req ] 
basicConstraints                = CA:FALSE 
keyUsage                        = nonRepudiation, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment   

[ v3_ca ] 
# Extensions for a typical CA 
subjectKeyIdentifier            = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier          = keyid:always,issuer:always
basicConstraints                = CA:true 

[ crl_ext ] 
# CRL extensions.  
authorityKeyIdentifier          = keyid:always,issuer:always 
```

> The v3req, v3ca and crlext definitions are required for OpenSSL to function properly. These sections define the basic configuration for a common certificate request and the required extensions to generate a CA certificate. The crlext section defines how CRLâ€™s are generated.

The complete openssl.cnf file should look similar to this:
```yaml
[ ca ] 
default_ca                      = IntermCA # The default ca section 

[ RootCA ]

### Step 4: Establishing our CAâ€™s

#### Setup Root CA 
Create Root CA public / private keypair

```bash
openssl genrsa -des3 -out ./RootCA/RootCA.key 2048
```

Generate Root CA certificate, which is by definition a self signed certificate. Donâ€™t forget to modify the validity to an appropriate value.

```bash
openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key ./RootCA/RootCA.key -out ./RootCA/RootCA.crt -config openssl.cnf
```

#### Setup intermediary CA(â€™s) 

Create Intermediate CA public / private keypair

```bash
mkdir -p ./RootCA/RootCA.db.certs/IntermCA 
openssl genrsa -des3 -out ./RootCA/ca.db.certs/IntermCA/IntermCA.key 2048
```

Generate Certificate Siging Request for intermediary CA. Donâ€™t forget to modify the validity to an appropriate value. 
```bash
openssl req -new -days 1095 -key ./RootCA/ca.db.certs/IntermCA/IntermCA.key -out ./RootCA/ca.db.certs/IntermCA/IntermCA.csr -config openssl.cnf
```

Sign the previously generated CSR using the RootCA while adding the CA extension to ensure that the resulting certificate can be used to sign other certificates. 

```bash 
openssl ca -config openssl.cnf -name RootCA -extensions v3_ca -out ./RootCA/ca.db.certs/IntermCA/IntermCA.crt -infiles ./RootCA/ca.db.certs/IntermCA/IntermCA.csr
```
 
Now copy over the relevant certificate and key to the IntermCA root.

```bash
cp ./RootCA/ca.db.certs/IntermCA/IntermCA.crt ./RootCA/ca.db.certs/IntermCA/IntermCA.key ./IntermCA/ 
```

Itâ€™s recommended to create a certificate chain file for future use. This file can be imported by a client and will indicate the full chain of Certification Authorities linked to the provided certificate. 

```bash
cat ./RootCA/RootCA.crt ./IntermCA/IntermCA.crt | tee -a ./RootCA/ca_chain.crt ./IntermCA/ca_chain.crt
```
## Common operations 
Thatâ€™s it, all relevant bits and pieces should be in place to start using our OpenSSL PKI. In this section you will find some common operations and the related openssl commands. 

### Generate server certificate
 ```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ./IntermCA/IntermCA.db.certs/ server.domain/server.domain.key -nodes -config openssl.cnf -out ./ IntermCA/IntermCA.db.certs/server.domain/server.domain.csr 
openssl ca -config openssl.cnf -name IntermCA -out ./IntermCA/ IntermCA.db.certs/server.domain/server.domain.crt -infiles ./IntermCA/ IntermCA.db.certs/server.domain/server.domain.csr
```

### Generate user certificate
```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ./IntermCA/IntermCA.db.certs/ username/username.key -nodes -config openssl.cnf -out ./IntermCA/ IntermCA.db.certs/username/username.csr 
openssl ca -config openssl.cnf -extensions usr_cert -name IntermCA -out ./ IntermCA/IntermCA.db.certs/username/username.crt -infiles ./IntermCA/ IntermCA.db.certs/username/username.csr
```
 
### Generate p12 
```bash
openssl pkcs12 -export -clcerts -in ./IntermCA/IntermCA.db.certs/ server.domain/server.domain.crt -inkey ./IntermCA/IntermCA.db.certs/ server.domain/server.domain.key -certfile ./pki.crt -out ./IntermCA/ IntermCA.db.certs/server.domain/server.domain.p12
```

### Revoke certificate 
```bash
openssl ca -config openssl.cnf -name IntermCA -revoke ./IntermCA/ IntermCA.db.certs/02.pem
```

### Generate CRL
```bash
openssl ca -config openssl.cnf -name IntermCA -gencrl -out ./IntermCA/ IntermCA.crl/crl-27.02.2014.pem
```

### Generate CA chain
```bash
cat ./RootCA/RootCA.crt ./IntermCA/IntermCA.crt > pki.crt
```
